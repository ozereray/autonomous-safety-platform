# 2026 Global Automotive Trends Analysis
## Introduction
The 2026 global automotive trends are centered around three key areas: autonomous driving, electrification, and connectivity. As the industry continues to evolve, the increasing demand for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has led to a focus on safety and security.

## Key Trends and Insights
The following trends are shaping the future of the automotive industry:
* **Autonomous Driving**: Autonomous vehicles are being tested and deployed worldwide, with a focus on Level 3 (conditional automation) to Level 5 (full automation).
* **Electrification**: Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction, driven by government regulations, decreasing battery costs, and increasing consumer awareness.
* **Connectivity**: Vehicles are becoming increasingly connected, with the integration of IoT devices, 5G networks, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.
* **Safety and Security**: Ensuring the safety and security of automotive systems is crucial, with a focus on:
	+ Implementing the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety
	+ Utilizing AUTOSAR for automotive software development
	+ Achieving ASIL-D (Automotive Safety Integrity Level D) integrity, the highest level of safety integrity

## Importance of Safety and Security
The rise of autonomous vehicles has highlighted the importance of safety and security in the automotive industry. By implementing the ISO 26262 standard and utilizing AUTOSAR, developers can ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of automotive systems. Additionally, achieving ASIL-D integrity is essential for guaranteeing the highest level of safety in autonomous vehicles.

## Example Use Cases
* Implementing ISO 26262 comments in code to ensure functional safety
